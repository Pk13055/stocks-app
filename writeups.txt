Here is the Wikipedia link of the Magic Formula and here is the methodology used by us to apply this formula and screen the stocks.

Above stocks provide the best dividend yield among the universe of stocks analyzed by us. Please note that high dividend yield does not necessarily mean high return as the yield is calculated based on the last dividend distribution and the company may decide to reduce or end dividend payouts in future.
